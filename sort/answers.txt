sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Fast on already sorted small list. Thats the best case: Î©(n). Increasingly slow on larger random/reversed lists: O(n^2).

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Not affected by the initial order of the list. The running time increases logarithmically as the lists grows: O(n log n).

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Same performance regardless of the initial order in the list: O(n^2) in all cases.
